Export the MyFitnessPal printable diary
=======================================

Create another view of the MyFitnessPal printable diary, if that diary is publicly viewable. This app displays an html table containing the diary info. It won't export weight/other measurements, but works with the printable diary (food, exercise, notes), which must be public. 

You can try it out at https://myfitnesspal-diary.glitch.me/
